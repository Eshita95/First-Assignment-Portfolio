            <p>2020 is a year for me to meet many targets. This year I want to see myself as a web developer. This is
                the year
                to fulfill my dream. I will do my best to develop myself as a web developer. Maybe there will be many
                obstacles,
                I will want to stop, but still I will turn around. I will not deviate from the path of fulfilling my
                dreams.</p>

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>There are several job titles that fall under the umbrella of “web developer.” A professional with
                    these
                    skills and knowledge is qualified to work in a number of positions related to web development and
                    computer programming.</p>

                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>After deciding I wanted to get into web development the first question on my mind was “What do I
                    learn?”
                    After doing some research, I ended up making my learning path based on what most entry-level web
                    developer
                    positions asked for.

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Im not here to talk about meaningless numbers that youll forget about in a couple of months. Instead,
                    your goals should be specific and measurable. They should be achievable, but should also push you!

            <p>Motivation leads to higher performance and satisfaction in the job. But how can we motivate a team of
                software developers? Sadly, there are common misconceptions about motivation that do more harm than
                good. Fortunately, science has already discovered the motivators that work: autonomy, mastery, and
                purpose. This post presents these three pillars of motivation and concrete actions to implement them in
                software development environments.</p>

            <p class="paragaraph">It’s no secret that the life of a programmer, especially that of a freelancer, can be pretty isolated. The more into the code we get, the more we don’t get out. We spend all of our time plugging away at our keyboards, looking for bugs or learning a new way to build an app so that it stands out from the crowd that it’s easy to forget there is a whole world out there.</p>
